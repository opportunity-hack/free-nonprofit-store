# Simple Nonprofit Store with Easy Deployment

## Overview
Create a lightweight, easy-to-use e-commerce solution for nonprofits to sell merchandise without incurring additional fees from platforms like Shopify. The solution should consist of a simple frontend store with payment integration and a backend system for easy deployment.

## Frontend Task

### Description
Develop a simple, static frontend store that can be easily customized by nonprofits. The store should integrate with either Stripe or PayPal for payment processing.

### Requirements
- Create a responsive, mobile-friendly design using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Implement a product listing page and individual product pages
- Add a shopping cart functionality
- Integrate with Stripe or PayPal for payment processing
- Use a static site generator (e.g., Next.js, Gatsby, or 11ty) for improved performance and SEO
- Implement a simple configuration file (e.g., JSON or YAML) for nonprofits to easily customize products, prices, and store details

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Responsive design works on desktop and mobile devices
- [ ] Products can be added to and removed from the shopping cart
- [ ] Checkout process is functional with Stripe or PayPal integration
- [ ] Store details and products can be easily configured without coding knowledge
- [ ] Clear documentation on how to set up and customize the store

## Backend Task

### Description
Create a backend system that interacts with the fly.io API to automatically deploy new instances of the frontend store for nonprofits.

### Requirements
- Develop a simple API that accepts nonprofit store configuration data
- Implement functionality to create a new fly.io app using their API
- Set up the necessary environment variables and configuration for the new app
- Deploy the frontend store code to the newly created fly.app
- Provide an easy-to-use interface (e.g., CLI tool or web form) for nonprofits to initiate the deployment process

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] API successfully creates a new fly.io app
- [ ] Frontend store is correctly deployed to the new fly.app
- [ ] Environment variables and configuration are properly set
- [ ] Nonprofit can easily initiate the deployment process without technical knowledge
- [ ] Clear documentation on how to use the deployment system

## Research Notes
- The only similar repo found is https://github.com/chrisdiana/simplestore
- Further research is needed to confirm if there are other similar open-source projects
- Investigate best practices for integrating payment processors in static sites
- Research fly.io API documentation and best practices for automated deployments

## Additional Considerations
- Ensure the solution complies with relevant e-commerce and nonprofit regulations
- Implement basic analytics to help nonprofits track sales and performance
- Consider adding features like inventory management and order tracking in future iterations
